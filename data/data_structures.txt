DOCUMENT TO EXPLAIN THE CHOICES OF DATA STRUCTURES:

-----How I stored Pet Animal and Wild Animal-----
- I have chosen an ordered linked list to read the pet animals and the wild animals.
  I made 2 separate lists for wild animals and pet animals.
  This choice is made because I want to keep the data ordered by animalID and the fact that if
  The user wants to remove and item, this can be accessed without changing the whole list.
  With a linked list it is easyer to find a particular animal because we don't have to travers the whole 
  list to find it (In a list [2, 4, 5, 7, 8] where we want to find the item 3 
  we can stop searching before the item 4.)
  The downside of using a linked list is that I can't perform searching algorithms like 
  "Binary search" so the time complexity of searching will be of O(n)





  TODO:
  -make a function in the LinkedList that searches for an entry 
  and returns a the actual object "animal"

  -test if the inheritance works and make functions for the 
  wild animal (or constructors)

  -check if the values entered into the objects are boolean
  (for example check if "Vaccinated" is a bool)

  -determine if the user entered id starts with W or P

  -produce a "readyForAdoption" function into the PetAnimal
  class. Returns a bool.

  -implement a "click to go back" after every function in the
  menu has finished working
