DOCUMENT TO EXPLAIN THE CHOICES OF DATA STRUCTURES:

-----How I stored Pet Animal and Wild Animal-----
- I have chosen an ordered linked list to read the pet animals and the wild animals.
  I made 2 separate lists for wild animals and pet animals.
  This choice is made because I want to keep the data ordered by animalID and the fact that if
  The user wants to remove and item, this can be accessed without changing the whole list.
  With a linked list it is easyer to find a particular animal because we don't have to travers the whole 
  list to find it (In a list [2, 4, 5, 7, 8] where we want to find the item 3 
  we can stop searching before the item 4.)
  The main advantage of using the linkedList is that you can insert and remove
  items that are in the middle of the list.
  The downside of using a linked list is that I can't perform searching algorithms like 
  "Binary search" so the time complexity of searching will be of O(n)





  TODO:
  -make a function in the LinkedList that searches for an entry 
  and returns a the actual object "animal"  ----Done

  -test if the inheritance works and make functions for the 
  wild animal (or constructors) ----Done

  -check wich animals have already left the sanctuary and
  deal with them

  -check that all the animal ready to be returned haven't got 
  surgeries impending 

  -read the TREATMENT file and store wherever --DONE

  -implement a function that gets the abusive owners --DONE

  -produce the sorting algorithm for the abusive owners

  -Make the remove item function

  




  Questions to professor:

  -Can we use built in lists to store data?

  -In the list for the animals ready for adoption does the table
  have to have explicitly stated "Adopted"?

  -In the list of animal ready for adoption do we have to check 
  the dates?

  -When we make the "lists" (readyForAdoption, abusiveOweners, etc..)
  do we have to return a list or print to screen?

  -when we create the entry for new arrival how do we go about asking 
  the user? and what about when we edit an animal?
